Lapfox Trax Redesign
====================

<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/22285634/public_images/LapfoxBranding.png" width="100%" />

<b>This is a redesign of the website for Ren Queenston's music label, <a href="http://lapfoxtrax.com/">Lapfox Trax</a>.</b>

I previously built another version based on a HTML/CSS/PHP/MySQL setup, but due to usability and hosting cost issues I was inspired to rebuild the project in a better way.

This website is now being built as a <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> app pulling real information from <a href="http://bandcamp.com/">Bandcamp</a> using their API. I'm using/planning to use the following tools to help out:

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://haml.info/">HAML</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/">Font Awesome</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://ricostacruz.com/jquery.transit/">jQuery Transit</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://capistranorb.com/">Capistrano</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://bandcamp.com/developer">Bandcamp API</a></li>
</ul>

I will keep the above list updated as new tools are added or removed.

To see updates as they happen, check out the current deploy on <a href="lapfox.etohehir.com">lapfox.etohehir.com</a>.

I hope with this project to create a framework not just for Ren, but for all artists on Bandcamp to have a great place to show off their music.
